"DevLife Portal" is a multifunctional backend for an interactive web portal, designed as a life and entertainment simulator for developers. It includes 6 unique mini-projects, each with its own game mechanics, and utilizes external APIs and artificial intelligence to create a dynamic and personalized experience.

## Author
* **D.B.**

## Implemented Projects (6 out of 6)

1.  **Code Casino:**
    * An interactive game where you guess the correct code snippet out of two options.
    * **Features:** A betting system, 2x point winnings, a leaderboard, a win streak system with bonuses, a daily challenge, and a zodiac-based luck multiplier.
    * **Content:** Challenges can be either static or fully generated using a **Codewars API + OpenAI** pipeline, stored in a **MongoDB** database.

2.  **Code Roast:**
    * A service for "roasting" user-submitted code.
    * **Features:** Fetches real programming challenges from the **Codewars API**, filtered by language and difficulty. User solutions are sent to the **Judge0 API** for execution, and the code, along with its execution result, is sent to **OpenAI** to generate a witty review.

3.  **Bug Chase:**
    * The backend for a real-time "endless runner" game.
    * **Features:** Implemented using **SignalR (WebSocket)**. A background service continuously generates in-game events (spawning obstacles: "Bug", "Deadline", "Meeting" and power-ups: "Coffee", "Weekend"). Includes a system for saving high scores and unlocking **achievements**, which are stored in **MongoDB**.

4.  **Show Me Your Code (GitHub Analyzer):**
    * A tool for analyzing public GitHub repositories.
    * **Features:** Supports authentication via **GitHub OAuth** (for users) and **Personal Access Token** (for developers). Uses the **GitHub GraphQL API v4** to fetch data on commits and project structure. **OpenAI (DALL-E)** is used to dynamically generate a unique image card based on the analysis.

5.  **Dev Dating Room:**
    * A dating simulator for developers.
    * **Features:** Uses a collection of fictional profiles stored in **MongoDB**. Implemented a chat-bot where replies from characters are generated by **OpenAI** based on their predefined personalities.

6.  **Escape the Meeting (Excuse Generator):**
    * A generator for creative excuses to skip meetings.
    * **Features:** Provides a random excuse based on a requested category ("Technical", "Personal", "Creative"). Implemented a "favorites" feature that saves preferred excuses to **Redis** for each user session.

## Technology Stack

* **Main Framework:** ASP.NET Core 9
* **Databases:**
    * **PostgreSQL:** For storing user data, scores, and records.
    * **MongoDB:** For storing game content (code snippets, achievements, profiles).
    * **Redis:** For session management and storing favorites.
* **Authentication:** Session-based and OAuth 2.0 for GitHub.
* **Real-time:** SignalR
* **Validation:** FluentValidation
* **Logging:** Serilog
* **External APIs:** OpenAI (GPT & DALL-E), Judge0, Codewars, GitHub GraphQL API v4.
* **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose

## Running the Project

The entire project is fully containerized and can be launched with a single command.

### **Prerequisites**
* **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.
* **.NET SDK 9.0** (for the best IntelliSense experience in your editor).

### **Setup Instructions**

1.  **Clone the repository.**

2.  **Create the `.env` file:** In the root project folder (`DevLifeBackend`), create a file named `.env`. Copy the content below into it and replace `xxx` with your actual API keys.
    ```dotenv
    # PostgreSQL - These values are used by docker-compose, no changes needed
    POSTGRES_USER=devlife_user
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=strong_password
    POSTGRES_DB=devlife_db

    # OpenAI API Key
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

    # GitHub OAuth App Credentials
    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=iv1.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    
    # RapidAPI Key for Judge0
    JUDGE0_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    JUDGE0_HOST=judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com

    # API-Ninjas Horoscope API Key
    HOROSCOPE_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```

3.  **Run the project:** Open a terminal in the `DevLifeBackend` folder (where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located) and run the following command:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    *The `--build` flag is only needed for the first run or after making code changes.*

4.  **Access the API:** Once all containers are up and running, open your browser and navigate to:
    `http://localhost:8080/swagger`

All API endpoints are now available for testing via the Swagger UI.
